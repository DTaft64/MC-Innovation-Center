# Maryland Montgomery College's Innovation-Center (IC)

This is where I'm gonna stick all of the stuff that I make for the innovation center, and the clubs that run out of it.
I'm doing this so future IC personnel may find it.
Right now, I have a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional logo.

# Idea List:
- Spinning logo sign in the hallway
- New tool organization area
- Lock all the drawers
- Locked supply cabinet (hopefully in the supply room)
